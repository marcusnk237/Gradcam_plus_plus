# Gradcam_plus_plus
The implementation of a 1d version of Grad-CAM ++ Algorithms which gives a better  Visual Explainations for the decisions made by Deep Learning Model Using Tesorflow-2.
This version can be use for 1d signal and time-series.

The output can be an image, with the signal as the foreground and the heatmap as the background

The output can be the signal with each important segment draw with a color which represent the importance for the classification/prediction
